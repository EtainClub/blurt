# Witnesses

The role of a witness in the Blurt Blockchain is to verify incoming transactions, produce blocks when scheduled, participate in governance.  In addition to this, there is a formal expectation that Witnesses advocate for the Blurt blockchain, review software, and build the Blurt community.  

## Witness Hardware

As many of you are aware, the hardware spec needed for running a Steem/Hive witness has grown significantly over the years!  

[privex.io](https://privex.io) currently offers a highly optomized Hive witness setup that they call Node In A Box(TM).

We have had some discussions about a Blurt-Flavored "Node In A Box(TM)", so in the long-term as the chain grows, their services may limit your costs.  

Additionally, a non-docker bash script AND a docker-based script will be developed and included in this repository.  

Our goal should be to ensure that we do not run on any single infrastructure provider.  While many of us have a bit of a [bare-metal server fetish](https://gitlab.com/virgohardware/core), the fact is that for Blurt's launch and likely for at least the first six months of Blurt's operation, you're not going to need a huge machine to operate a Witness.  We are considering further optomizations to Blurtd which would permanently lower the RAM consumption on both Witness and Seed nodes, but that's as of yet incomplete.  Here is a [reasonable machine spec](https://whaleshares.io/@faddat/witness-post#@faddat/re-daking-re-faddat-witness-post-20200612t195020198z) that should give you a ton of growing room.  

**Infrastructure Providers**:
What's important here is that everyone is not using only a single provider.  

| **Provider**   |      **Machine Types**      |  **Price** | **Special Feature** |
|----------|-------------|------|------------|
| hetzner.de |  Bare Metal and Cloud |  Competitive | Cheap Bare Metal |
| privex.io |    Bare Metal and Cloud   |  Mid-range | Privacy, Peering, Cryptocurrency Payments, Witness Optomization, Team has steemed since 2016 |
| vultr.com | cloud and bare metal |  Mid-Range | Easy and straightforward |
| digitalocean.com | cloud | mid-range | tutorial ecosystem |
| contabo.com | cloud | low | Price AND one time I saw a contabo node outperform nearly all others in a network stress test situation on the [akash.io](https://akash.io) testnet. |
| Your local hosting provider | bare metal | ? | Diversify the Witness Set |
| GCE | Cloud | high | admin features |
| AWS | Cooud | high | industry leader for infrastructure |



**Machine Spec**:
Your Witness machine spec is entirely **your** choice.  This recommended spec should be relatively low cost ($5-20 per month) and should also run your Blurt Witness very effectively.  

Accurate as of **June 15, 2020**:

**Blurt Witness Spec**

|  Component |  Size     |

| **CPU** |  2+ Cores |
| **RAM** |    4GB   |
| **Storage** | 80+GB |

## Witness Setup Procedure
**Valid for Testnet 1, June 16, 2020:**

Blurt nodes run well on many Linux distributions, but we recommend Debian 10. 

Make sure that you disable password logins on your potential witness machine and that you login to it ONLY using an SSH keypair.  If you rent a machine with password logins enabled by default, no problem.  Do like:

```bash
ssh-copy-id root@youripaddresshere
```
Enter your SSH password, and `ssh-copy-id` will copy your SSH public key to the server so that you no longer need to use a password to login.  

Test this like:

```bash
ssh root@youripaddresshere
```

If it doesn't ask you for a password, you've been successful in setting up proper passwordless SSH that uses a signature by your SSH private key to authenticate you instead of a password.  If it asks for a password, you've failed.  

After you've SSH'd into your server (without it asking for a password) on your server, you should disable password-based logins like this:

```bash
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find this line:
```
#PasswordAuthentication no
```

You should change it to:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Press `ctrl + o` to save the file, and `ctrl + x` to exit the nano editor.   

Then run
```bash
service ssh restart
```

We've reduced setting up a full node to a single-line installer:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/blurt/blurt/-/raw/dev/doc/witness-full-node.bash)
```

There, now you're running a very nice Blurt Full Node, but you are not yet running a Witness.  In order to run a witness, you'll need to import your Steem active key using the `cli_wallet`.  

So now you'll need to run `cli_wallet`. (type cli_wallet and hit enter)

The first thing you should do is set a password, like:

```
set_password yourpassword
```

You'll also want to `suggest_brain_key`.  

Copy down its entire output and keep it safely.  You'll be using this brain key to control your Witness.  

**import your Steem Active key**

```
import_key 5KABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ
```
Note: the key should start with a 5

**Add private key to config.ini**

First exit the cli_wallet:

```
Ctrl+D
```

In the code below, replace BRAIN_KEY_WIF_PRIV_KEY with the previously generated Brain wif_priv_key and replace "jacobgadikian" with your own Blurt account name: 

```
echo "private-key = BRAIN_KEY_WIF_PRIV_KEY" >> /blurt/config.ini
echo 'witness = "jacobgadikian"' >> /blurt/config.ini
systemctl restart blurtd
systemctl status blurtd
```

**Declare that you're a Witness** 

Use the command `cli_wallet` to go back into the wallet and then unlock it with:

```
unlock yourpasswordhere
```

Use the below code, but first replace the Blurt account name with your own; replace the blog URL with your own blog (Blurt, Hive, Medium, Steem etc) and the Brain public key with yours which you generated previously: 

```
update_witness "jacobgadikian" "https://whaleshares.io/@faddat" "BRAIN_KEY_PUBLIC_KEY_GOES_HERE" {"account_creation_fee":"3.000 BLURT","maximum_block_size":65536} true
```

Success looks like this:
```json

  "block_num": 12142,
  "transaction_num": 0
}
```

It's also a very good idea for you to vote for yourself from the CLI wallet, so that you will begin to make blocks:

Note: gopher23 is an account name.  You'll want to replace `gopher23` with your own account name in the voting step.  The first name is the account that you're voting from, and the second is the account that you're voting for.  

**vote for yoursself**
```
vote_for_witness gopher23 gopher23 true true
```

**vote for someone else**
```
vote_for_witness gopher23 megadrive true true
```

## Common Cli Wallet Commands

Open Cli Wallet:
```
cli_wallet
```

Unlock Wallet:
```
unlock yourpassword
```

Exit Cli Wallet:
```
Ctrl+D 
```

## Common Blurtd Commands

Check block production status:

journalctl -u blurtd --no-pager --since "1 minute ago"
```


## Social Expectations

Please get to know one another.  Know how to contact one another in case of an emergency. You literally operate the Blurt community.  Have multiple secure ways to talk to one another in case something goes wrong. 

[Tox](https://tox.chat) has no central servers whatsoever, is reliable, and uses public key cryptography for every aspect of its operations.  Generally, I (Jacob) trust Tox more than alternatives like Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Slack and other "secure" chat setups.  I (Jacob) be making a Tox Blurt Witness group, but I strongly encourage you to have your own solutions for getting ahold of other Witnesses should the need arise.  

## Security Disclosures

If you encounter a security issue with your witness or other Blurt infrastructure, please contact security@blurt.foundation **and** these people individually by messaging apps of your choice:

* Jacob Gadikian (faddat or jacobgadikian depending on platform)
* Tuan Pham Anh (Baabeetaa)
* David Vennik (Loki / l0k1 / )
* Ricardo Ferreira (thecryptodrive)

We take security very seriously and it is also no problem to publicly disclose security issues.  You will not pay a [social penalty](https://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/steem-and-bitshares-cryptographic-security-update) for making [security disclousures](https://steemit.com/life/@inertia/q437x6) to the Blurt community.
