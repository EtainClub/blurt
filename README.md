## Features

* Remove the downvote function. 

## Launch Plans

* Blurt is a fork of the Steem blockchain that begins operating on July 4th, 2020. 

## Centralization

* A regent account with a controlling stake or special weighted vote is added to the blockchain at the time of the fork. 

* The regent account votes on consensus Blurt Producers and DAO proposals. 

* **The regent account does not impact**:
  * circulating supply
  * new inflation A.K.A. organic supply
  * the rewards pool. 

## Decentralization

* The regent account will be programmed to decay to zero or just simply cease to exist after two years, the exact methodology is yet to be determined.
* Prior to deprecating the regent account, the Blurt blockchain will be updated to feature secure consensus protocols, such as One-Stake-One-Vote, to reduce the risk of centralised consensus attacks from large stake accounts.

* Staked BLURT is called BLURT POWER

# Software Status

This repository currently contains a fork of the Steem blockchain code.  Blurt will launch as a fork of the state of Steem on July 4, 2020.  If you compiled this software today, you would just be compiling Steem code, so we've removed the compile and deploy instructions for now, but they'll return soon.
